### 💡 Why Red-Black Tree?

Red-Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees that provide **guaranteed logarithmic time** for insert, delete, and search operations. Compared to other trees:

- ⚖️ More balanced than basic BST (avoids skewed shape)
- ⚡ Faster insert/delete than AVL in dynamic environments
- 🛠️ Used in real-world systems like C++ STL, Java TreeMap, and Linux kernel

Perfect fit for a **realtime, dynamic tracking system** like this.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – fast, responsive UI styling
- **JavaScript** – full Red-Black Tree logic built from scratch
- **No backend** – everything runs in the browser!
